## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- I learned from online sources that I can place a header element inside a section.
- I had a better understanding of "display:block" and how elements with this property expands to fill the width of their containers.
- I implemented the mobile first design, before writing media queries for larger screens (i.e. tablets and desktops).
- Applied transform (translateY) on hover and active state, which ensures the full interaction feels natural for users/visitors.

### Continued development
- I would continue to explore how to create layouts that are responsive across many screens and devices.
